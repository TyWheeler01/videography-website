                <h2>Do you Travel?</h2>
                <p>Yes! I'd love to capture your big day no matter where you are located. I am based in the Massachusetts in the Bristol County region. Travel is often included in packages however, if your wedding is considered long-distance travel charges may be applicable. If flight and or hotel stay is required, these charges may be applied additionally. Reach out and I'll get a quote to you that includes travel costs with your package selection.</p>

                <h2>How are packages structured?</h2>
                <p>I believe that each couple has a unique vision for their wedding video, and I strive to provide packages that accommodate their individual needs and preferences.</p>
                <p>Current package offerings can be provided through a pricing brochure when contacting me. The starting price for the lowest tier package offering is currently $1,900+.</p>
                <p>When selecting a package, I always recommend that couples consider the level of coverage they need, the length and style of the final video, and any specific requests or special moments they want captured. As a professional, I am available to discuss these options and help couples select a package that fits their budget and meets their expectations.</p>
                <p>My ultimate goal is to provide couples with a wedding video that they will cherish for a lifetime. I understand that this is a significant investment, and I want to ensure that couples are completely satisfied with their package and the final product.</p>

                    <p>The final film will be delivered through a link on "VidFlow". This is essentially a little personal website dedicated to your wedding film. You can watch, download and stream your love story all through the link. If your package included a physical USB then it will be shipped immediately upon completion of the film.</p>
